QRNAS: Quick Refinement of Nucleic Acid Structures 

1. Functionality
QRNAS is a software tool for fine-grained refinement of nucleic acid structures, dedicated to improving the quality of models generated by low- to medium-resolution methods commonly used, e.g., for RNA three-dimensional (3D) structure modeling. QRNAS is capable of handling RNA, DNA or chimeras and hybrids thereof, and enables modeling of nucleic acids containing modified residues. The force-field used by QRNAS is a modified version of AMBER adopted to represent 107 modified nucleotides currently known to be present in RNA.
